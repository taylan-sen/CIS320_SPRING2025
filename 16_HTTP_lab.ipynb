        "**HTTP** stands for **hyper text transfer protocol**. It specifies the communication rules that a **webclient** (such as chrome, firefox, or edge) and a **webserver** (such as apache2) use to communicate with each other. Typically, the webclient requests a particular webpage, and the webserver sends the html of the page. Sometimes the webclient will send data back to the webserver, for example, when filling in forms on webpages. Recall that **html** stands for hyper text markup language, a language for creating web pages; it is different than http.\n",
