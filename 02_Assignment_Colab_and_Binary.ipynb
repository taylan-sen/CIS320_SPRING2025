        "**Base 10.** In the base 10 number system, we use the digits 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. A shift of one digit to the left means the digit represents 10 times more (ex: 2 and 20), two spaces to the left means multiplying by 100. Stated another way, the rightmost position of a base 10 integer represents the number of *ones* ($10^0$), the second from the right position represents the number of *tens* ($10^1$), the third from the right position represents the number of *hundreds* ($10^2$), and the $n^{th}$ position from the right represents the number of $10^ns$. For example, the number 234 means: four ones, three tens, and two hundreds.\n",

        "**In base 2**, or binary, only the digits 0 and 1 are used. For example, 101 is a binary number representing the decimal number 5. (Note: we usually write binary numbers with a leading \"0b\" so that we don't confuse them with decimal numbers, i.e. 101 --> 0b101) The rightmost binary integer position represents the number of *ones* ($2^0$), the second from the right position represents the number of *twos* ($2^1$), the third position from the right represents the number of *fours* ($2^2$), the fourth position from the right represents the number of *eights* ($2^3$), and so on. Base 2 is especially important for computers since data is usually represented by elements that can be in one of only two states. For example, as mentioned earlier, the voltage on a wire can be either high or low, representing either a 1 or 0. Each digit in binary represents a ***bit*** of data. Eight bits of data are called a ***byte***.\n",

        "**In base 16**, also called hexadecimal, the sixteen digits 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F are used. When writing a number in hexadecimal, we usually write it with a leading \"0x\". For example 0x10 represents 16 in base ten. A shift of one to the left represents multiplying by 16, a shift of two to the left represents multiplying by 256 (i.e. 16*16), and shifting by $n$ spaces to the left represents multiplying by $16^n$).\n",
